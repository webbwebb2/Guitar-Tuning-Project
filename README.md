Purpose:

  This project is introduced by Professor Robert Katiuga and Osama Alshaykh. The goal is to design and build a auto tuning module which can then be attached on a travel guitar. 
  
Hardwares:
  1. Arduino Uno
  2. Stepper Motors: 28BYJ-48
  3. 3D printed components: gears, mounts etc.
  4. Electronic components: sound sensor, wires, transistors, resistors, multiplexers etc.

How to use the code:

The main code can be found in<br/>./Arduino/test_1/control_test/.<br/>
INO file can be opened via Arduino IDE, Processing or any text editor. Also, all included *.cpp *.h files can be founded in<br/> ./Arduino/libraries/lib/
