# Guitar-Tuning-Project

Our team start the project by purchasing a already-built travel guitar to work with. We are looking for ways to connect the current output from the tuner to the circuit in order to drive the motors. Wish us luck!

The main code can be found in ./Arduino/test_1/control_test/. 
INO file can be opened via Arduino IDE, Processing or any text editor
